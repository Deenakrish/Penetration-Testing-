# Step 1: Lab Verification – Overview

Purpose:
To ensure that the virtual penetration testing lab is correctly configured, the attacker machine can communicate with the target machine, and the network environment is stable.

Objectives:
- Validate the VirtualBox/VMware Host-Only network configuration.
- Confirm attacker VM (Kali) connectivity to the target VM (Metasploitable 2).
- Capture basic ARP and network communication for initial environment validation.

Target Subnet:
          
    192.168.56.0/24

Target System:

    Metasploitable 2 – 192.168.56.102
